Work on parser for cmds
Work on parser for path
Work on storage for previously parsed data.

Am I supposed to open the file, write to it and then close it?
i think so yeah, in the sense that I write the output of the 
program behind x-command to the outfile or to the next pipe.


What does execve need again?
Should I build the house first, or the data first? Does it really matter rn?
